      "content": "73% of coffee drinkers experience existential dread when their drink goes cold. 89% suffer from 'roast regret' due to suboptimal bean-to-brain interfaces. Legacy mugs lack blockchain integration and fail to leverage your LinkedIn activity to adjust brew temperature. Coffee deserves a Web4-ready upgrade."
